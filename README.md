# Language Archive Collector — Header buttons reduced, footer toolbar

**What changed**
- Header now shows only: **Total clock + progress bar**, **New Entry**, **Save Entry**.
- All other global buttons were moved to the **footer**:
  - Theme toggle, Run QC, Export JSON, Export CSV, Import JSON, Clear Form.
- Footer also shows your org line:  
  **Shema Bible Translation, University of the Nations. YWAM Kansas City.**
- The previous “Notes: entries are saved locally …” line is removed.

Everything else remains as in the last build (ideas-first flow, per‑genre clocks, waveform trim, CSV export of transcript sentences, search, QC, etc.).
